# e-tivity-3-intents

This is my E-Tivity 3 for ED5042

this app shows the use of using 3 differnt channels.

Channel one shows a notifctaion with a light and sound but will not show at the top of the screen.

Channel 2 will show a notification at the top of the screen in addition to eveerything channel 1 can do.

NOTE: the custom notification text field input only works with channels 1 & 2, channel 3 displays a default message. 
//this is due to using a completly different method to call upon channel 3.

channel 3 is set start a 15 second timer,then ping a notification when the 15 second timer is up and uses a BCR, i tried to demonstrate different ways of essentially doing the same thing here.
